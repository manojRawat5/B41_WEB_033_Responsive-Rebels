Crime Reporting Project - README
Project Overview
The Crime Reporting Project is a web-based application that allows users to report crimes, view reported crimes in their area, and analyze crime patterns. The system provides a user-friendly interface for both citizens and law enforcement to contribute and access crime-related information. This project aims to increase awareness, improve community safety, and facilitate more effective law enforcement responses.

Search and Filter: Users can search for specific crimes and apply filters to find incidents in particular locations or involving certain crime types.
Crime Analytics: Provides data visualizations to help users understand crime trends over time and across different areas.
User Authentication: Secure login and registration system for both citizens and law enforcement officials.
Admin Dashboard: Admins can view all reported crimes, verify reports, and monitor user activity.
